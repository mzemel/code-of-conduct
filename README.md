# NewHaven.io Code of Conduct
Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

Unpopular opinions are welcome, so long as their assumptions do not challenge those of the mission.  For example, opinions like racial superiority are unacceptable because they necessary conflict with egalitarianism and universal human rights, which is the foundation of our mission of inclusivity.  On the other hand, conservative, libertarian, and other non-progressive opinions are acceptable so long as they are not predicated on any assumptions that conflict with the moral imperatives of equality, democracy, and non-violence.

When confronted about an unpopular opinion, remember to be respectful, empathetic, and appreciative of how other people could be affected differently by an application of your principle.  If civility cannot be maintained, there should be an arbitration whereupon either both parties come to consensus, that conversation is avoided or, as a last resort, one of the parties is removed from a channel or the organization.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.1.0, available from http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/
